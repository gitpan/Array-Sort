NAME
    Array::Parallel - Sorting Parallel Arrays

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of Array::Parallel, released
    January 2004

SYNOPSIS
          use Array::Parallel;

          @your_ratings = (2, 3, 1);
          @husbands = ('fred', 'archie', 'homer');
          @wives = ('wilma', 'edith', 'marge');

          $array = Array::Parallel->new(\@your_ratings, \@husbands, \@wives);
          ($your_ratings, $husbands, $wives) = $array->sort('num');

          for my $num ( (0 .. $#{@{$your_ratings}} ) ) {
              print "You rated $husbands->[$num] and $wives->[$num] number $your_ratings->[$num]\n";
          }

DESCRIPTION
    Does Parallel Array sorting. Sorting 1 Array and then matching up the
    keys from the first one to sort a second array, third array, ect. Take a
    look at the Synopsis if you are confussed about what I mean.

    A more efficent way would be to use hash keys instead of using this
    module. But, this might be good for a lot of cases. I would test this
    module with the extremes of what data you expect before trusting it
    though.

METHODS
    Just two methods for now

  new

      Just the constuctor
      Usage: $a = Array::Parallel->new(\@sorted_array, \@next, ..);

  sort

      Sorts arrays to first array. Returns references to all arrays supplied. Takes 1 arguement. Either "num" to sort $a <=> $b, and "cmp" to sort $a cmp $b
      Usage: ($sorted_array, $next, ..) = $a->sort("num");

EXPORT
    OO Nothing

HISTORY
    0.01    Version .01 - Everythins new. Functions are: new (constructor)
            and sort/parasort. Probably bugy. I wouldn't trust it for
            important things.

BUGS
    Unknown, but they're there.

    Please use the Module RIGHT. Not much in way of error messenging (well,
    not error messenging actually). As long as you give it arrays of equal
    length it won't freak out. If it doesn't work right tell me. This is a
    beta for a reason.

TODO
    They call this version .01 for a reason. I have to do a lot.
    Contribution will be well accepted :-)
